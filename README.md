# Emoji-Predictor-Using-Least-Square-SVM

We have taken up a small project based on the emoji predictor that assigns the predicted emoji in a conversation. This project takes in the particular conversation sentence as input and predicts the emoji-based upon the given content. (In our case the content is the sentence).We will be using SVM classifier for achieving our goal. We will compare different SVM procedures like L1, L2. Based upon the given conditions we will be selecting the optimal kernel function and also the hyperparameters.
