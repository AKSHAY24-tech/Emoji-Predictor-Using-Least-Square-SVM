i feel insulted that i was the victim in this triangle
i could feel my calf muscles starting to get grouchy and i had a cramp around my ribcage
i know it wouldn t have solved anything but i m sure that it would have momentarily made me feel less agitated for sure
i am walking around feeling quite tortured because i spent so many hours on it and it is still not finished but i have learned a few things
i was more annoyed with the info dump because it made the book too long but i feel i ll miss something if i skipped it which annoyed me more pages
i have a feeling im going to be heartless
i often find my self feeling offended myself when i hear people who i believe to be otherwise brilliant people following what i consider odd superstitions and strange rituals
i took a minute to appreciate the trees around me and the calming energy that they gave me at a time when i was feeling a little bit irritable
i moved away he said something that made me feel violent but its something i still cant make out
i feel like this was such a rude comment and im glad that t
